# Bounce
A basic platforming game project created to better understand how to use Unity.

The goal of this game is to make it to the last platform. You are a ball that bounces off any surface touched. There are a series of platforms you must traverse to finish the game. There are currently 3 types of platforms that affect the height of your bounce and if you fall between the platforms the level will restart. The level is procedurally generated each reset.
